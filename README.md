# Trails
Trails is a project similar to classical data logger projects. The main goal is to aggregate GPS data in ThingSpeak, process them in MATLAB, and visualize them in an aesthetic and minimalist way.

GPS data is sent using a custom shortcut created in the Shortcuts app on my iPhone. The data is transmitted in a loop while a custom focus mode is turned on.
The core elements of the shortcut's logic are presented in a screenshot, while the full workflow is illustrated as a block diagram.

The mentioned images, as well as demo charts with erased axis values, a removed geographical plot, and reoriented data (all due to location security reasons ðŸ˜ƒ), are available in the [docs/images](./docs/images) catalog.
